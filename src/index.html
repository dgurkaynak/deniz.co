    <p id="about-text">
      He is a two-legged human being who loves engineering and making
      stuff. He is driven by his constant curiosity and anything that
      challenges him. He, most of the time, doesn't know what he is doing,
      and also he can't multi-task. He likes science, sports, games, dogs, and beer.
      In randomness he trusts.
